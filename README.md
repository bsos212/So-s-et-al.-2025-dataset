This Python script can create plots similar to the ones in Soós et al. 2025

This code was developed by:

Andrés Yagüe López (https://github.com/AndresYague) and
Benjámin Soós (https://github.com/bsos212)

==========How to use=========

Simply run the script:

-python3.8 SLRsVSmeanlife.py

This script plots the predicted and observed radioactive-to-stable abundance ratios in the ESS divided by their stellar production ratios, against the respective mean life of the SLRs (for a more detailed description of the plot see Soós et al. 2025).

-isotope_data.yaml

This file contains all the necessary data for the code SLRsVSmeanlife.py.
